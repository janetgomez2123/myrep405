  <h5>“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough!”</h5>

   <p>Minister Hermione Jean Granger (b. 19 September, 1979) was an English Muggle-born witch born to Mr and Mrs Granger.
     At the age of eleven, she learned about her magical nature and was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
     Hermione began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. She possessed a brilliant academic mind and proved to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied.</p>

    <p>Hermione first met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express,
     who found her unfriendly and somewhat of an "insufferable know-it-all",
     an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors.
     However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991,
     surprising them in a grateful way, which led to them quickly becoming friends.</p>
