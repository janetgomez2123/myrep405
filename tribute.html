<div class="main">
   <p>Minister Hermione Jean Granger (b. 19 September, 1979) was an English Muggle-born witch born to Mr. and Mrs. Granger.
     At the age of eleven, she learned about her magical nature and was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
     Hermione began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. She possessed a brilliant academic mind and proved to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied.</p>

<div class="second">
    <p>Hermione first met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express,
     who found her unfriendly and somewhat of an "insufferable know-it-all",
     an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors.
     However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991,
     surprising them in a grateful way, which led to them quickly becoming friends.</p>

    <p>Following the Second Wizarding War, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to complete her education.
      She later found employment with the Ministry of Magic, furthering the cause for the better treatment of house-elves.
      Afterward, she was promoted to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, where she dedicated herself to eradicating old laws that were biased in favour of pure-bloods.
      Hermione eventually married Ron Weasley and together they had two children, Rose and Hugo. She became the godmother of Harry and Ginny Potter's eldest son James.
      By the year 2019, Hermione had become the Minister for Magic.
